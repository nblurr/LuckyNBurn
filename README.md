# üé∞ LuckyNBurnHook ‚Äì Gamified Uniswap v4 Hook with Dynamic Fees, Token Burning & Loyalty System

**LuckyNBurnHook** is a custom [Uniswap v4 hook](https://github.com/Uniswap/v4-core) that introduces a **gamified fee structure** with burn mechanics and a **loyalty program**. Each swap has a randomized chance of being categorized into one of four tiers: **Lucky**, **Discounted**, **Normal**, or **Unlucky**. Depending on the outcome, the fee varies, and part of the fee may be burned (destroyed forever üî•). The more you trade, the better your odds become!

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Mechanics
- üé≤ **Randomized Fee Tiers**: Each swap randomly lands in a fee tier with defined probabilities
- üßä **Lucky Swaps**: Pay the lowest fees (with cooldown)
- üí∏ **Discounted & Normal Swaps**: Reduced or standard LP fees
- üî• **Unlucky Swaps**: Highest fees, with a portion sent to a burn address

## üß™ Tier Mechanics

Each swap is assigned to a fee tier based on random chance (with loyalty bonuses):

| Tier       | Base Chance | Fee Addition (bps) | Description                          |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Lucky**      | 10%         | 0 bps             | Cooldown-based freebie               |
| **Discounted** | 30%         | 25 bps            | Slightly reduced fee                 |
| **Normal**     | 50%         | 50 bps            | Standard fee                         |
| **Unlucky**    | 10%         | 100 bps           | Highest fee; 50% burned üî•           |

> üß† Base fee is **0.3% (3000 pips)** and tier fee is added dynamically on top.

## üèÜ Loyalty System

The loyalty system rewards frequent traders with better odds and lower fees:

### Loyalty Tiers

| Tier        | Swaps Required | Lucky Bonus | Fee Discount | Cooldown Reduction |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Bronze**    | 0-19           | +0%         | 0%           | 0%                |
| **Silver**    | 20-49          | +2%         | -0.25%       | -15%              |
| **Gold**      | 50-99          | +4%         | -0.5%        | -30%              |
| **Diamond**   | 100-199        | +7%         | -1%          | -50%              |
| **Legendary** | 200+           | +12%        | -2%          | -75%              |

### Milestone Bonuses üéñÔ∏è

- **50th swap**: +1% permanent lucky chance bonus
- **100th swap**: +2% permanent lucky chance bonus
- **500th swap**: +5% permanent lucky chance bonus
- **Volume milestones**: +0.2% lucky chance per 100 ETH traded (up to 50 milestones)

### Benefits Explained

- **Lucky Bonus**: Additional chance to hit the lucky tier (stacks with base 10%)
- **Fee Discount**: Applies to ALL tier fees (lucky, discounted, normal, unlucky)
- **Cooldown Reduction**: Lucky tier cooldown reduced (1 hour base ‚Üí 15 minutes for Legendary)
- **Milestone Bonuses**: Permanent bonuses that stack on top of tier bonuses

---

## üßØ Burn Logic

- Only **Unlucky swaps** trigger token burning
- The fee is split: part goes to LPs, and the other part is sent to the burn address
- Default burn address: `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`
- Burn share configurable by owner (default: 50% of unlucky fees)

---

## üîß Admin Functions

The contract owner (deployer) can adjust:

### Core Settings
- `setChances`: Tier probabilities (must sum to 10,000)
- `setFees`: Basis points added per tier
- `setCooldownPeriod`: Cooldown for Lucky rewards
- `setBurnConfig`: Burn address and burn share

### Loyalty Settings
- `setLoyaltyConfig`: Update swap thresholds, bonuses, discounts, and cooldown reductions

---

## üèóÔ∏è Create a Pool, Attach the Hook & Provide Liquidity

Below is a quick guide to deploy your pool and become a believer by adding liquidity.

### 1. Deploy the Hook

After deploying Uniswap v4 core contracts, deploy `LuckyNBurnHook` with the `PoolManager` address:

```solidity
new LuckyNBurnHook(poolManagerAddress)
```

> This returns your hook address, e.g., `0x123...abc`

### 2. Encode the Hook into the PoolId

When creating a new pool, encode the hook into the `PoolId` using Uniswap's helper:

```solidity
PoolKey memory key = PoolKey({
  currency0: Currency.wrap(address(token0)),
  currency1: Currency.wrap(address(token1)),
  fee: LPFeeLibrary.DYNAMIC_FEE_FLAG, // Enable dynamic fees
  tickSpacing: 60,
  hooks: address(luckyNBurnHook) // Your deployed hook
});
```

Then compute the PoolId:

```solidity
bytes32 poolId = PoolIdLibrary.toId(key);
```

### 3. Initialize the Pool

Use the `PoolManager` to initialize your pool with a square root price (encoded as sqrtPriceX96):

```solidity
poolManager.initialize(key, sqrtPriceX96);
```

### 4. Provide LP as a Believer

Choose your tick range and desired liquidity amount, then provide LP like this:

```solidity
poolManager.lock(
    address(this), 
    abi.encodeWithSelector(
        IPoolManager.modifyPosition.selector,
        key,
        IPoolManager.ModifyPositionParams({
            tickLower: -600,
            tickUpper: 600,
            liquidityDelta: int128(1e18)
        }),
        ""
    )
);
```

This effectively adds liquidity to the pool. You are now a **LuckyNBurn LP believer** ‚úäüî•

## üß† Tips & Debug

- Use `hookData = abi.encode(trader, salt)` for swaps to ensure randomness works as intended
- The hook supports `log_balances()` to debug token flows from the pool, hook, trader, and burn address
- You can view `collectedForBurning(currency)` for real-time insight into burn amounts per token
- Monitor loyalty progression with `getLoyaltyStats()` to see tier upgrades and bonuses
- Track milestone achievements through emitted `MilestoneReached` events

---

## üìä Events

The contract emits comprehensive events for tracking:

### Swap Events
- `Lucky(trader, feeBps, timestamp)` - Lucky tier achieved
- `Discounted(trader, feeBps)` - Discounted tier achieved
- `Normal(trader, feeBps)` - Normal tier achieved
- `Unlucky(trader, feeBps, burnAmount)` - Unlucky tier with burn amount

### Loyalty Events
- `LoyaltyTierUpgraded(trader, newTier)` - Tier progression
- `MilestoneReached(trader, milestone, bonus)` - Milestone achievements

### Admin Events
- `SetChances`, `SetFees`, `SetBurnConfig`, `SetCooldown` - Configuration updates
- `SetLoyaltyConfig` - Loyalty system updates
- `TokensBurned` - Burn execution events

Use these to power a gamified frontend with real-time loyalty tracking! üìà

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This hook uses **pseudo-randomness** (e.g., blockhash, timestamp) and is **not safe for mainnet production**. Intended for experimental or educational use. Use real randomness (e.g., Chainlink VRF) for production.

---

## üß† Why This Matters

The LuckyNBurnHook brings life and randomness into Uniswap swaps while **rewarding loyalty**. It:

- **Rewards traders** with better odds and lower fees over time
- **Punishes greed** through unlucky burns while **encouraging engagement**
- **Creates deflation** through systematic token burning
- **Gamifies liquidity** with progression systems and milestone rewards
- **Injects excitement** into DeFi with unpredictable outcomes and VIP treatment

It's a new way to build **sticky, engaging DeFi protocols** that reward your most active users! üöÄ
